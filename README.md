# SuperSimpleMetronome
A barebones React Native metronome app without any bloat. Made for some learning experience. Use at your own risk. It does support the following features:
* Dynamic theme change by device color scheme changes
* Input validation
* BPM and beat number modifications

## Installation
You can either install the `.apk` from releases or download the source code and compile it yourself. The project is built using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and React Native with [expo framework](https://docs.expo.dev/). Check the [EAS Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) for more information about building from source. It may also be compiled for IOS as well, but I haven't tried it myself. 

## License
The source code is made available under the MIT license. But some of the dependencies may be licensed differently.
