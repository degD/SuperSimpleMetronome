    0. Let's assume the beating is playing

    2. The index will return to the beginning
    3. Boxes will be redrawn with updated values
    4. The beating will continue from the beginning

    0. When play state changed
    1. First, the beating will stop
    2. The index will return to the beginning
    3. Boxes will be redrawn with updated values
    4. The beating will continue from the beginning

As beat index is also used for ticking, it might be better to
not directly modify it. Instead, I will use a state variable called
"begin".
